* What is Docker

- not a *VM*
- isolated Linux process (using *groups* and Linux *capabilities*)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem
that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools,
system libraries â€“ anything you can install on a server. This
guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the
environment it is running in.[5]

* Ingredients

- cgroups:
  resource limiting
- kernel namespaces:
  isolate application view of the OS
- union-capable filesystem:

* Good reasons

- Why Developers Care
- Build once... (finally) run anywhere*
- A clean, safe, hygienic, portable runtime environment for your app.
- No worries about missing dependencies, packages and other pain points during subsequent deployments.
- Run each app in its own isolated container, so you can run various versions of libraries and other dependencies for each app without worrying.
- Automate testing, integration, packaging...anything you can script.
- Reduce/eliminate concerns about compatibility on different platforms, either your own or your customers.
- Cheap, zero-penalty containers to deploy services. A VM without the overhead of a VM. Instant replay and reset of image snapshots.
